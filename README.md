# FinanceTracking

The start of my habit bettering applications, a personal finance tracker. This application will allow me to view all accounts in 1 consolidated place to enforce better spending and budgeting habits. I will be able to set financial goals and it will guide me on where to shift certain funds around to achieve them.
